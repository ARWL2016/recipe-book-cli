<h2>Angular 2 Recipe Book App</h2>
<p>This application was built with Angular 2, Typescript, SystemJS and Bootstrap to meet the criteria of the FreeCodeCamp challenge 
  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-recipe-box" target="_blank">Build a Recipe Box</a>. 
  That challenge specifies the React framework, and an alternative version of this app, built with React, can be seen 
  <a href="https://recipe-book-arwl.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Because of the flakiness of the React framework, I decided to rebuild the whole app in Angular as a comparison.</p>
  <p>The data for this application is kept in the browser local storage, and will persist between sessions.</p>
  <p>The source code for can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ARWL2016/recipe-book-app-ng" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
